## [Demo](http://angular-scope-types.surge.sh/)

This is still in the early stages. This is currently available as a beta on `npm`. Basically this is intended
to bring a concept like React `propTypes` to Angular.

This is based on trying to support [this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/11657) with as clean an api
as possible.
