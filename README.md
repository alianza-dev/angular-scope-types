This is still in the early stages. Wont be pushed to `npm` or `bower` until it's ready to go. Basically this is intended
to bring a concept like React `propTypes` to Angular.

This is based on trying to support [this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/11657) with as clean an api
as possible.

Here's the [prototype](http://jsbin.com/vimude/edit?html,js,console,output). This is going to be great :-)

Let me know in the issues or on gitter if you want to help out!
